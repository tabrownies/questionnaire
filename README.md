# Questionnaire*
An open source multiplayer *[Kahoot](https://kahoot.it) style* quiz game

**Name Subject to Change*

## Vision
*Where there is no vision, the people (or coding project) perish* <!--make exact and add reference-->

These are the end goals of this coding project, many of which are far enough ahead in the future that without significant help, they will never be reached;, however, as explained above they will help ensure this coding project succeeds rather than perishes.

1. A deployable application which allows one device to locally host a quiz which unlimited devices can connect to, or at least as many as the host machine can handle
1. A website which hosts games on a server people can connect to
    * This will likely involve pay to cover server expenses and perhaps an income for full time developers and managers (myself included)
1. An open source project beginners can feel comfortable contributing to

## Plans and Milestones
1. Create a full detailed plan of the application's functionality. This should include both the MVPs (minimum viable products) for the first two points of the above vision as well as features to be added to both after the minimum viable product is achieved.
    * What technologies will be used
    * How everything will interact
    * this step is subject to change the rest of the steps
1. Determine the file structure of the quiz files
1. Create a game that operates off of a single quiz file
1. Expand the game to locally allow you to choose quiz files **Milestone**
1. Create a quiz-creator application (Questionnaire Studio?) **Milestone**
1. Polish the local game and studio to publish as version 1.0 **Milestone**
1. Develop a website and server that allows users to store their quizzes in the cloud to download and use locally **Milestone**
1. Expand the website to allow the quizzes to be played on the servers **Milestone**
1. Create a store for sharing quizzes between users **Milestone**

### Extra ideas
To add ideas open a Github issue with the tag **New Idea**. Once approved open a pull request as part of that issue to this document which adds the idea to the bottom of this list, unless otherwise instructed.
* use QR codes on local hosting to provide the IP address of the host machine to players
* use yaml for quiz files
    * include version number
    * maybe use folder so images and sound can be included
* provide some way to alert hosters how many players their system should be able to handle
* Develop a style guide which is maintained by a linter
    * use GitHub actions for linter
* compress the folder for quizzes into a single file for easy sharing
